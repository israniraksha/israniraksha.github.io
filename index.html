                <span id="f">Hello, I am Raksha Israni, I recently graduated with a master's degree in information systems. I also had the pleasure of serving as a teaching assistant for database management. As part of my graduate curriculum, I did an internship with Philips. I worked with R&D team on Patient Information Centre where I helped them to build Microsoft Azure widgets which helped in monitoring the pipelines used for automation and validation, and another widget to showcase the aging defects and work items that needed attention.
Prior to this I completed my bachelor's degree in information technology and started my career with Dell. I started as a junior engineer gradually progressing to development lead. At Dell, I worked with the customer communication engine team primarily responsible for all notifications flowing out of Dell's order management ecosystem. I helped the team from building the product from scratch to being deployed in 40+ countries, catering multiple language support.
After Dell, I joined NoBroker where I contributed to their checkout and payments team. During my time at NoBroker, I focussed on integrating the system with multiple banks and payment service providers to improve the system robustness. Here I took the responsibility to fix the issues with refund process saving around 30-40 hours effort per month for the customer support team and helped the payment system employ the measures to detect and stop fraud payments.
My academic and professional endeavors have helped me hone my skill sets in programming languages, databases and helped me understand people coherence and leading team. I am self-motivated individual who understands the balance of teamwork and individual contribution. I have always worked with customer-first approach and advocated innovation. At this junction of my career I am looking for roles that will help me create impactful solutions by leveraging my skill sets and also grow while undertaking challenging responsibilities.</span>
